      "**Detailed Feedback in English:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Does the answer follow the STAR format?**\n",
      "   - **Situation:** The candidate briefly describes a teammate failing to respond to messages, causing project delays. However, the situation lacks sufficient context (e.g., what the project was, why timely communication was critical, and the urgency or stakes involved).\n",
      "   - **Task:** The task is implied as the need to address the teammate’s lack of responsiveness and ensure the project’s timely completion, but it is not explicitly stated.\n",
      "   - **Action:** The candidate mentions scheduling a 1:1, identifying personal issues, redistributing responsibilities, and increasing check-ins. While these are reasonable actions, they lack strategic depth or evidence of broader influence.\n",
      "   - **Result:** The result is stated as completing the project on time, but it is vague and not quantified (e.g., how much delay was mitigated, or what the impact of completion was on the business or team).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Does the response demonstrate senior-level behaviors?**\n",
      "   - **Leadership and Initiative:** The candidate shows some initiative by scheduling the 1:1 and addressing the problem, but this is more indicative of mid-level ownership. Senior-level candidates are expected to exhibit broader leadership, such as anticipating systemic issues or influencing team dynamics more broadly.\n",
      "   - **Influence Across Teams or Functions:** The answer is narrow in scope and does not demonstrate cross-functional influence or collaboration.\n",
      "   - **Strategic Problem-Solving:** The resolution appears tactical (redistributing tasks and increasing check-ins) rather than strategic. For example, the candidate could have addressed underlying systemic issues or implemented process improvements to prevent similar challenges.\n",
      "   - **Clear and Measurable Outcomes:** The result is vague and lacks data or metrics to highlight impact. Senior candidates should articulate measurable outcomes (e.g., saved X weeks of delay, improved team productivity by Y%).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Is the language clear, concise, and persuasive?**\n",
      "   - The language is clear but lacks senior-level confidence and persuasion. Phrases like \"I proactively scheduled a 1:1\" and \"found out he was dealing with personal issues\" are functional but not impactful. The tone could better reflect ownership, leadership, and the ability to drive outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Constructive Feedback:**\n",
      "   - Add more context to the situation (e.g., describe the project, its importance, and the stakes).\n",
      "   - Explicitly state the task to show clarity of responsibility.\n",
      "   - Expand the scope of actions to include strategic steps, such as identifying systemic issues or collaborating with other leaders to mitigate risks.\n",
      "   - Quantify the results to demonstrate measurable impact.\n",
      "   - Use language that reflects senior-level confidence and leadership.\n",

      "\n",
      "*\"In a recent project to launch a critical feature with a tight three-month deadline, I noticed a key teammate was consistently unresponsive, causing delays in deliverables and risking the timeline. Recognizing the potential impact on the broader team, I took the initiative to schedule a 1:1 to understand the root cause. Through the conversation, I learned he was dealing with personal challenges that were affecting his focus and availability. \n",
      "\n",
      "To address the issue, I proposed a short-term redistribution of his critical tasks among the team, ensuring that deliverables remained on track. I also implemented weekly check-ins with him to provide ongoing support and maintain visibility into his progress. Additionally, I escalated the situation to my manager and recommended bringing in temporary support for the high-priority tasks, ensuring the team's overall productivity wasn't compromised.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, we not only completed the project two weeks ahead of schedule but also strengthened team morale by fostering a culture of support and collaboration.
